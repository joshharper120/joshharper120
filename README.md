### Hey there, I'm Josh! 

I'm a Mechatronics Engineering student studying at UWaterloo ⚙️. <br>

My interests include vehicle automation, electrification, and all things aerospace 🚀. <br>

When I'm not working on a new design, I enjoy playing the bass guitar and doing stupid challenges with my friends 😅
